This repository contains games that have been developed from scratch with the goal of letting a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent playing them.

## Games 
1. Move in a [grid world](https://github.com/amjadmajid/DRL/tree/main/ValueIteration) to a destination location. Solved by the Value Iteration algorithm 
2. Move in a [grid world](https://github.com/amjadmajid/DRL/tree/main/ValueIteration) to a destination location. Solved by a DQN agent with feed foreword neural network layers.
3. [Snake](https://github.com/amjadmajid/DRL/tree/main/Snake) game solved by a DQN with feed foreword neural network layers.
4.  [SnakeCNN](https://github.com/amjadmajid/DRL/tree/main/SnakeCNN) game solved by a DQN with Convolution neural network layers.
